# Shapes R-Package

Generate Shape Coordinates with ease.

## Generic Development Process

1. Define User Requirements
2. Create Conceptual Design (wireframes or proof of concept code)
3. Define Acceptance Criteria
4. Create new Branch
5. Follow a TDD (Test Driven Development) to implement Design
6. Merge Branch to Main

> Note: After each Merge identify Abstraction and Generalization opportunities and Implement in seperate branch and merge after test pass.

This process was followed irritatively in this repository. See the list of User Requirements, Conceptual Design and Acceptance Criteria using the links below. 

## Sequence of User Stories Implemented:
1. [Generate Rectangle Coordinates](https://github.com/FlippieCoetser/Shapes/issues/1)
2. [Convert Radians to Degrees and Back](https://github.com/FlippieCoetser/Shapes/issues/4)
3. [Convert Polar Coordinates to Cartesian Coordinates and Back](https://github.com/FlippieCoetser/Shapes/issues/5)
4. [Generate Circle Coordinates](https://github.com/FlippieCoetser/Shapes/issues/2)
5. [Consolidate Shape Coordinates Generators](https://github.com/FlippieCoetser/Shapes/issues/9)

All branches associated with user stories have been left active

Also notice the last iteration focused on abstraction. Where Abstraction is the process of combining related functions or operations into a unified component, simplifying their access and use by grouping them under a broader theme or purpose

Lastly, in one of the above user requirements one important acceptance criteria is missing. See if you can generate and plot a rectangle and circle to identify the missing feature or criteria. If you find it, Create a new GitHub ticket and follow the process outlined above.
